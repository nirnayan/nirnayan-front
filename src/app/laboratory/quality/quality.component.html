We must maintain various quality protocols internally and externally to adhere to our quality control policy and provide the right reports. As we deal with a good workflow on an everyday basis, we maintain records in our software system on a periodic basis. We have laboratory information systems (LIS) that are ideally connected to electronic patient records.  An integrated, tier-based laboratory system requires the ability to transmit data to and from multiple testing sites as well as to forward results to clinicians and selected test results to patients for self-monitoring, to public health authorities, and to disease registries.</p>
